# Design Patterns

A software design pattern is a general, **reusable** solution to a **commonly occurring** problem within a given
 context in software design. Design patterns are formalized **best practices** that the programmer can use to solve
  common problems when designing an application or system.
  
Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on kind of problem they solve:
* [Creational Patterns](#creational)
* [Structural Patterns](#structural)
* [Behavioral Patterns](#behavioral)

## <a name="creational">Creational Patterns</a>

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with **object creation** mechanisms
, trying to create objects in a manner **suitable** to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in
 design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow
  controlling this object creation.
